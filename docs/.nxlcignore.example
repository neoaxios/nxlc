# .ulcignore Example
#
# IMPORTANT: Rename this file to '.ulcignore' (remove .example) to use it
# Place in the root directory you're analyzing (where you run ulc from)
# Note: Unlike .gitignore, .ulcignore is NOT processed in subdirectories
#
# ULC only counts files with recognized programming language extensions.
# Use .ulcignore to exclude specific source files or directories from counting.
#
# Pattern syntax (same as .gitignore):
#   dir_name/       - Ignore directory and all its contents
#   *.pattern       - Ignore files matching pattern
#   **/pattern      - Match pattern in any directory
#   !pattern        - Negate previous patterns (include back)

# Example: Exclude generated source code files
*.generated.py
*.auto.cs
*_pb2.py           # Protocol buffer generated Python files

# Example: Exclude specific test directories
load_tests/
stress_tests/
**/*benchmark*/

# Example: Exclude vendored/third-party code
vendor/
third_party/
external_libs/

# Example: Exclude build configuration files that match source extensions
*.cmake.in
config.h.in

# Example: Include specific files back (negate exclusion)
# Exclude all SQL except migrations
*.sql
!migrations/*.sql

# Example: Exclude example/sample code
examples/
samples/
**/test_data/
